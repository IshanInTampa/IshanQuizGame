# IshanQuizGame
Time Travel Challenge — 1960s–1970s is a quiz game where you “travel” through key pop culture and technology milestones from the 1960s and 1970s. You answer 20 multiple-choice questions across 2 levels (Pop Culture and Tech). Each correct answer gives +5 points with a happy sound and confetti; wrong answers trigger a sad sound and an upset NPC face.

Instead of restarting after three wrong answers, the game tracks your progress with Time Stability (3). Each mistake lowers stability; when it hits 0 you enter Recovery Mode (you keep your place and stats, then continue after a small score penalty). The game also tracks score, accuracy, streak/best streak, and missed questions, and it saves progress in your browser so refreshing won’t erase your run.
